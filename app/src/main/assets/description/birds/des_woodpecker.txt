The woodpecker has a tough, pointed beak which it uses to chip on bark, drum on trees, and find insects. The tip of their bill is chisel-shaped and sharp from all the pecking on wood. The tongue of a woodpecker can span up to four inches long. On its tongue is a glue-like substance which helps in extracting insects.
