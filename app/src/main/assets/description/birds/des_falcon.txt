Falcons are raptors, or birds of prey, with sharp talons on their feet, and sharp curved beaks. They are incredibly skilled predators on the wing, and their narrow wings enable them to maneuver perfectly in the air. There are approximately 40 different species of these birds, all in the taxonomic genus Falco.
